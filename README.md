# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
As a Data Scientist at Cognizant, I have been entrusted with leading a team to analyze the diverse sales data of our client, Gala Groceries Limited. Gala Groceries, a burgeoning grocery store chain in the United States, has witnessed remarkable growth over the past five years and views Whole Foods as its main competitor.

Gala Groceries takes pride in offering top-quality, fresh produce sourced from local suppliers. However, maintaining this standard consistently throughout the year poses significant challenges.

Gala Groceries has sought Cognizant's expertise to address a supply chain issue. Due to the highly perishable nature of groceries, overstocking results in excessive storage costs and waste, while understocking risks losing customers. They are seeking insights into optimizing their inventory levels.

The Data Engineering team at Cognizant has compiled sample sales data from a week. My team is tasked with providing recommendations on additional data requirements to meet Gala Groceries' business needs. Furthermore, we are to develop a Python module featuring machine learning models to support this analysis.


# PROJECT SUMMARY
This project aims to solve a significant business problem by utilizing data analysis and machine learning techniques. It is structured into four main tasks:

1. **Data Exploration**: Analyze the available data and develop key questions to address the client's supply chain issues.
2. **Data Modeling**: Prepare and preprocess the data for subsequent analysis and model development.
3. **Model Building and Interpretation**: Create machine learning models to predict optimal inventory levels and interpret their outcomes.
4. **Machine Learning Production**: Implement and deploy the models for real-time inventory management.


# TASK BREAKDOWN

**Task 1: Data Exploration**
  * Analyze the dataset to gain insights into Gala Groceries' inventory and sales history.
  * Formulate questions and hypotheses related to inventory optimization.

**Task 2: Data Modeling**
  * Preprocess the dataset, including handling missing data and feature engineering.
  * Explore different data modeling techniques suitable for inventory forecasting.

**Task 3: Model Building and Interpretation**
  * Develop machine learning models for predicting optimal inventory levels.
  * Interpret the model outputs to provide actionable insights.

**Task 4: Machine Learning Production**
  * Implement the chosen model(s) into a production environment for real-time inventory management.
  * Monitor and maintain the deployed solution for continuous improvement.
